This folder containes the code where datasets has been downloaded ready to be analyzed.
The goal of this project is to make a program that calculates and shows forecasts of the air quality. 
The user can put in any health conditions as Astma or Allergies, so the program can give the user relevant warnings.
To analyze tha air quality, data about the pollutants O3, NO2, CO, SO2, PM10, PM2.5 needs to be fetched.

The python file Functions_FetchData.py contains the selfmade functions for downloading data.
The FetchData.py uses the functions to download the datasets that is going to be used further for analyzes.
